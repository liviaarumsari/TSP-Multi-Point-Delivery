# TSP-Multi-Point-Delivery
This program searches for the most optimal route given the adjacency matrix of eight location samples. This algorithm is adapted from greedy approach to TSP to support Discrete Mathematics paper on "Traveling Salesman Problem Application for Multi-Stop Delivery Route Optimization".

## How to Run
1. Open the directory of the program
2. Run by typing this command into terminal
```
 python main.py
```

## Room for Improvement
This program only use a static data for sampole, but it can be developed into using a real-time location data to support real application of multi-point delivery.
